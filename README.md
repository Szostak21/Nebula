The **Modes** screen lets you experiment with different gameplay variants:
- Turtle mode (slow speed)
- Sonic mode (very fast speed)

- Wide mode (a LOT of lanes)

Each mode can be toggled for a fresh challenge, making Nebula highly replayable and easy to extend.

- **Python + Kivy:** Rapid prototyping with a modern UI toolkit.
- **Resource management:** Assets referenced simply, with custom fonts and sound effects.
- **Perspective math:** Transform utilities for consistent, reusable effects.
- **Declarative UI:** Modular KV files for clean visual structure.
